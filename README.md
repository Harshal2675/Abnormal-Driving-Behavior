# Abnormal-Driving-Behavior
A Machine Learning project on Identifying Abnormal driving behavior using Spatio-Temporal analysis by creating a binary classifier.

# Methodology:
- Feature Engineering
- Training K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using grid search.
- Predicting Tracks as normal and abnormal driving behaviors by evaluating the performance of the classifier.
- Model evaluation
- Image generation (accuracy loss)

# Results:
- Our model achieved an accuracy of 75.38% in distinguishing between normal and abnormal driving trajectories.
